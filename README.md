# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview 

In anticipation of a large number of Pewlett Hackard's work force becoming eligible for retirement, management has asked for an analysis of their workforce database utilizing SQL. Specifically, the number of retiring employees by their title was determined, and employees who are eligible for participation in the mentorship program were identified. Analysis of this data follows.

* over 90,000 employees will be eligible for retirement 
* over 29,000 senior engineers will be retiring  
* Only 2 managers will be retiring 
* 1,500+ employees are eligible for the mentorship program 

## Summary 

Overall, as shown above, over 90,000 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact. Perhaps the most important roles needed to be filled will be the 2 department managers that will be leaving as illustrated in the table below. Filling of these positions should take upmost priority as both the sales and Research departments will be without a leadership until then.

In relation to the mentorship program, it is beneficial to look at which specific departments each of the 1,500+ eligble employees come from, and also how many non-retiring employees these mentors would be responsible for. As the table below illustrates, it seems almost all the departments are in good shape, and have close to the same ratio of mentors to employees, which is roughly between 90 and 130 employees per mentor.
